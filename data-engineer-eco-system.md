## Core Big Data Concepts
### Big Data
Large amounts of data that cannot be processed on one computer. Needs distributed systems.

### Hadoop
An open‑source framework to store and process big data across many machines.

### HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
Storage layer of Hadoop.
Stores huge files by splitting them into blocks and distributing across machines.

### MapReduce
Processing layer of Hadoop.
Breaks a job into:
  Map → split work
  Reduce → combine results

### Cloudera
A company that provides enterprise Hadoop distributions and tools.

## SQL & Warehousing
### SQL
Language to query and manipulate data in databases.

### Warehouse / SQL Warehouse
A system optimized for analytics (not transactions).
Stores structured data and runs fast SQL queries.

### ACID
Database properties:

Atomic
Consistent
Isolated
Durable
Ensures reliable transactions.

### CDC (Change Data Capture)
Technique to capture only changed data (inserts/updates/deletes).

### Incremental Loads
Loading only new or changed data instead of full data every time.

## Data Movement Tools
### Sqoop
Tool to transfer data between Hadoop and relational databases.

### Sqoop Job
A saved Sqoop command that runs repeatedly (scheduled import/export).

### Data Proc
Google Cloud’s managed Hadoop/Spark service.

### Data Stream
Google Cloud’s streaming ingestion service (similar to Kafka).

## Spark Ecosystem
Spark
Fast, distributed data processing engine (much faster than Hadoop MapReduce).

### Apache Spark
The open-source version of Spark.

### Spark Cluster
Group of machines running Spark.

### Master Node
Controls the cluster, assigns tasks.

### Worker Nodes
Execute the tasks.

### PySpark
Python API for Spark.

### RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
Low-level Spark data structure.
Requires manual optimization.

### DataFrame
High-level table-like structure.
Optimized automatically (recommended).

### RDD vs DataFrame (simple):  
RDD = manual, slow
DataFrame = optimized, fast


## Databricks Ecosystem
### Databricks
Cloud platform built on Spark with extra features for data engineering, ML, and collaboration.

### Notebooks
Interactive coding environment (Python, SQL, Scala).

### Jobs
Scheduled or automated tasks (ETL pipelines, scripts).

### Workflows
Chained jobs with dependencies (like Airflow).

### DBFS (Databricks File System)
Databricks’ internal storage layer.

### Delta Lake
Storage format built on top of Parquet with ACID transactions.

### Delta Table
A table stored in Delta format.

### Auto Loader
Databricks feature to automatically ingest new files from cloud storage.

### MLflow
Tool for tracking machine learning experiments, models, and deployments.



## Cloud Big Data Platforms
### BigQuery
Google Cloud’s serverless data warehouse.

### EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
AWS’s managed Hadoop/Spark service.


## File Formats
### Parquet
Columnar file format.
Fast for analytics, compresses well.

### Serializable
Ability to convert an object into a format that can be stored or transferred.

### ETL vs ELT
ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)
Transform data before loading into warehouse.

ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)
Load raw data first, then transform inside warehouse.


## Difference Between Databricks on Azure, AWS, GCP, Community Edition
### Azure Databricks
Deep integration with Azure services (ADLS, ADF, Azure SQL)

Best for enterprise security (AAD, VNET)

### AWS Databricks
Integrates with S3, Glue, Redshift

More flexibility for custom networking

### GCP Databricks
Integrates with GCS, BigQuery

Newer compared to Azure/AWS

### Community Edition
Free, limited version

Single small cluster

Good for learning, not for production
